A smart quality analysis system that evaluates fruit freshness and pesticide levels using a combination of image processing and sensor data. The system captures images of fruits, processes them using a trained EfficientNet model, and integrates pH sensor readings to determine quality. The results are displayed on a web interface for easy access.  

• Developed an image-based classification model using EfficientNet to predict fruit freshness.  
• Integrated a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to capture fruit images for real-time analysis.  
• Implemented a pH sensor interface to assess fruit acidity and enhance prediction accuracy.  
• Designed a data fusion approach combining deep learning and sensor data for quality assessment.  
• Built a web-based interface to display analysis results, improving accessibility and user experience.
